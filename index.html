      <h3>Dr.&nbsp;Jonas Salk and the polio vaccine</h3>
      <p>After being appointed head of the Virus Research Lab at the University of Pittsburgh in 1947, Dr.&nbsp;Jonas Salk devoted himself to finding a way to curb the devastating virus. Less than five years later, he invented a vaccine and decided to test it out.</p>
      <blockquote>
        There is hope in dreams, imagination, and in the courage of those who wish to make those dreams a reality.
        <footer>Dr.&nbsp;Jonas Salk.</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>After working successfully on a sample group that included Salk, his wife and their three sons, a nationwide testing of the vaccine was launched in April 1954. The impact was dramatic: in 1955 there were 28,985 cases of polio in the U.S. and by 1957 that number had decreased to 5,894.</p>
      <blockquote>Since he wanted it to be distributed freely to everyone, Dr.&nbsp;Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine.</blockquote>
      <p>Today, in the U.S., cases of polio are extremely rare and The World Health Organization hopes the disease will be eradicated worldwide in the near future.</p>
      <p>Of course, that didn't stop inventor Dr.&nbsp;Jonas Salk from keeping busy&nbsp;â€” his last years were spent searching for a vaccine to combat AIDS.</p>

      <h3>What is Polio?</h3>
      <p>Polio (also known as poliomyelitis) is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. Children younger than 5 years old are more likely to contract the virus than any other group. Polio attacks the nerve cells and sometimes the central nervous system, which can cause paralysis or even death.</p>
